# myfirstblocks

Today I start my technical jorney into the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I've spent a couple of years studying the concepts, the economics, and the business implications. My time to code has come. With this project I celebrate that. 

My second test failed, but this is the third. Hope to have learned how to do this this time around.
